<p class="about2">
  It all started with that quote. "What does it mean?" you may be asking. <br>
  Well, how about the man, the myth, the legend, Tooru Oikawa tells you himself. (in the F.A.Q.'s) <br> <br>

</p> <br> <br>
    
<p class="about3">
    Our goal is to strive to make this world more of a community with our bread. <br>
    Our bread is homemade and "Delicious!" (Says a journalist from the New Tokyo Times) <br>
    We work our hardest to make sure our bread is made with not only clean hands, <br>
    but also clean spirits. Our workers love it here! <br>
    The building was also built for the sole purpose of becoming a bakery, <br>
    so we at Oikawa's Bread Break can assure you that it is not haunted, <br>
    no matter what disgruntled workers named Tendou say.

    The employee of the month is: <br>
    Satori Tendou! <br> <br>
    <img class="picoftendou" src="images/Tendou1.jpg" alt=""> <br>
    We thank you, Tendou for providing "Delicious!" (Says a New Tokyo Times Jounalist)
    chocolate to the bakery, to be put in just as <br>
    "Delicious!" (Says a New Tokyo Times Journalist) bread!
